To set up our program, first obtain the GUI and SQL code. Change the 'Password' field to your SQL password in order
to connect to the drone_dispatch database. Then simply run the program on your terminal or in your IDE to start up.
Technologies used includes Python Tkinter, SQL Connector, MySQL, etc. 
Harsh and Aakash tackled implementing the procedures and ensuring the functionality works based on the GUI interactions.

Ved exhaustivly tested the program for bugs as well as assisted in the UI and MySQL integration.
